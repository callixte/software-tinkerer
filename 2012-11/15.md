Ubuntu in a kvm on SmartOS
===

The [documentation](http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/How+to+create+a+KVM+VM+%28+Hypervisor+virtualized+machine+%29+in+SmartOS) is pretty straight forward and acurate.

Here is my template json:
```json
{
  "alias": "ubuntu59",
  "brand": "kvm",
  "default-gateway": "10.XX.XX.1",
  "hostname": "ubuntu59",
  "ram": "2048",
  "vcpus": "2",
  "nics": [
    {
      "nic_tag": "admin",
      "ip": "10.XX.XX.59",
      "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
      "gateway": "10.XX.XX.1",
      "model": "virtio",
      "primary": true
    }
  ],
  "resolvers": [
    "10.XX.XX.1",
    "8.8.4.4"
  ],
  "disks": [
    {
      "image_name": "system",
      "image_uuid": "78ab4d60-2610-11e2-b3f7-b3bd2c369427",
      "image_size": 20480,
      "media": "disk",
      "boot": true,
      "model": "virtio"
    }
  ],
  "customer_metadata": {
    "root_authorized_keys":
"ssh-rsa XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
}
```

Then you will need to update _/etc/hostname_ (and potentially _/etc/hosts_ if you do not have local DNS) to reflect the correct host name.
(and a _vmadm reboot UUID_ from the GZ helps.)

Ther you go: your VM is ready for you to ssh into as root.

Deploy a [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/) cluster
===

Here are the steps I followed to deploy a Storm cluster.

I am using four VMs running Ubuntu on a SmartOS host.

1. ZooKeeper
2. Nimbus
3. Supervisor
4. Supervisor

Install ZooKeeper
--

I figured out that using Cloudera Manager would be the easiest way for me to install ZooKeeper. The more so because I will need to deploy an Hadoop cluster in the near future. You just have to download a script, run it on one of your host (one that have ssh access to the others) and go to the web management interface.

In my case, I just deployed ZooKeeper on the same host, which may not be a good idea as it then appears as _localhost_ and _hostname_.

Install 0MQ and JZMQ
--

[0MQ](http://www.zeromq.org/area:download) is installed following the documented steps.
```
# apt-get install libtool autoconf automake uuid-dev g++ unzip
# wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-2.1.7.zip
# unzip zeromq-2.1.7.zip
# cd zeromq-2.1.7.zip
# ./configure
# make
# make install
```
