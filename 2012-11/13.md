Analytics and boolean combination in JS
=

In our Analytics, we work on *facts* that have *properties*. The *properties* are expressed in the form of *tags*. If the *fact* has a certain *property*, the corresponding *tag* is set. Otherwise, there is nothing.
Then, we have *metrics*, which are a boolean combination of *tags*:
```
my_metric = tag1 & tag2 | (tag3 & !tag4)
```
An easy way to represnt that in Js would be to have a set of *tags* as a property of our *fact* object:
```javascript
fact1.tags = { tag1, tag3, tag22 };
```
But then, the *metric* will not be that easy to implement. It has to use set functions, which can be slow and all the boolean combination has to be re-implemented.
